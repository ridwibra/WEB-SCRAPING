      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "Acer 5 Slim, review, upgrades, and Windows 10 S mode\n",
      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped. The screen is a solid IPS screen and when you consider the price tag is amazing and beats a lot of the more expensive laptop screens I have seen.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers.

The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love.

If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "Acer 5 Slim, review, upgrades, and Windows 10 S mode\n",
      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed.

In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad.

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers.

The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love.

If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school.

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.

Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things!

So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped. The screen is a solid IPS screen and when you consider the price tag is amazing and beats a lot of the more expensive laptop screens I have seen.\n",

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers.

The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love.

If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "Acer 5 Slim, review, upgrades, and Windows 10 S mode\n",
      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed.

In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

      "This is NOT a Budget Laptop!\n",
      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n"

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "Acer 5 Slim, review, upgrades, and Windows 10 S mode\n",
      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school.

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around.

The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped. The screen is a solid IPS screen and when you consider the price tag is amazing and beats a lot of the more expensive laptop screens I have seen.\n",

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Fantastic Deal for the Price\n",
      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped. The screen is a solid IPS screen and when you consider the price tag is amazing and beats a lot of the more expensive laptop screens I have seen.\n",

I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets.

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "Excellent value! Just needs a couple inexpensive upgrades\n",
      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "Acer 5 Slim, review, upgrades, and Windows 10 S mode\n",
      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.

It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped. The screen is a solid IPS screen and when you consider the price tag is amazing and beats a lot of the more expensive laptop screens I have seen.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long.

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "Acer 5 Slim, review, upgrades, and Windows 10 S mode\n",
      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "Fantastic Deal for the Price\n",
      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped. The screen is a solid IPS screen and when you consider the price tag is amazing and beats a lot of the more expensive laptop screens I have seen.\n",

I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD.

I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers.

The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love.

If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "Acer 5 Slim, review, upgrades, and Windows 10 S mode\n",
      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed.

In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad.

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers.

The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love.

If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school.

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.

Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things!

So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped. The screen is a solid IPS screen and when you consider the price tag is amazing and beats a lot of the more expensive laptop screens I have seen.\n",

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers.

The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love.

If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "Acer 5 Slim, review, upgrades, and Windows 10 S mode\n",
      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed.

In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad.

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers.

The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love.

If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school.

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.

Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things!

So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped. The screen is a solid IPS screen and when you consider the price tag is amazing and beats a lot of the more expensive laptop screens I have seen.\n",

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers.

The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love.

If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "Acer 5 Slim, review, upgrades, and Windows 10 S mode\n",
      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed.

In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad.

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers.

The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love.

If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you!

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school.

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "Won't be wrong at this price\n",
      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.

Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped.

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things!

So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp.

      "  The Acer 5 slim is sleek, beautiful, durable, lightweight, lightning fast (when upgraded to 16gb of ram), and has a ridiculously low price tag. It probably wouldn't be of much use for gaming or CAD, but for basic web browsing, office use, and video streaming, it will do well. I have added some pictures next to a macbook air for size comparison. The screen is bright and beautiful, offering 1080p resolution. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the keyboard lights up! I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain! I hope you found this review helpful, if so, please kindly click the \"helpful\" button! Thank you!\n",

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped. The screen is a solid IPS screen and when you consider the price tag is amazing and beats a lot of the more expensive laptop screens I have seen.\n",

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

I plan to use this laptop mainly to stream business news, news tickers, and follow several stocks on multiple tabs. For this reason, I knew the RAM upgrade would be necessary. This PC would likely be quite slow if you chose to keep the 4GB of RAM, as 2GB is shared memory. I would recommend at the very least adding another 4GB stick, as there is a slot available and a 4GB stick is quite cheap. I decided to add a second hard drive as well, 128GB is not much, if I recall correctly, only 98GB was available, and that was before any Windows updates!I spent an extra $116 on the following upgrades:Teamgroup 16GB (8GBx2) - 2666MHz , DDR4 Dual-channel laptop memory, and a Kingston 480GB A400 SATA 3 2.5\" Internal SSD hard drive. The fact that Acer made this laptop with 2 memory slots and a spot for a second harddrive is part of the reason this laptop has been a bestseller for so long. Without these options I wouldn't have considered purchasing it. I have included pictures of the laptop with the back cover removed, at various stages of adding the Kingston 2.5\" SATA harddrive. It is an incredibly easy procedure, but I thought some may benefit from the photos. A bag of screws to secure the harddrive actually came with the laptop, which I included it in one of the photos. Replacing the memory is straightforward. To remove the back panel to access the internals, you simply remove 10 phillips screws.After installing the second hard drive, you will probably need to head over to disk management to partition the new drive. Be very careful with this step, as you can really mess your computer up & delete data, if you click on the wrong things! I haven't installed a second hard drive in ages, I expected windows to gind the drive after the installation, but that wasn't the case for me!This PC includes Microsoft Windows 10 in S mode. I suppose some people will be ok with this mode, as it enhances security and performance by only allowing programs available in the Microsoft Store. The vast majority of us however, will want to switch out of this mode ASAP. Fortunately switching modes is a very simple procedure. Here is the process:Go to Settings  > Update & Security  > Activation.In the Switch to Windows 10 Home section, select Go to the Store. There is also an \"upgrade your edition of Windows\" section on the screen during this step, do NOT click the \"Go to the Store\" link below that!On the Switch out of S mode page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.Congratulations! Your new computer now has Microsoft windows 10 home, without the restrictions of S mode!Bottom line - this laptop is an absolute bargain!

      "  This laptop is a fantastic deal for the price. The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer.  The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped. The screen is a solid IPS screen and when you consider the price tag is amazing and beats a lot of the more expensive laptop screens I have seen.\n",

      "  I could sit here and write all about the specs on this computer, but they are already in the description, and If you are like me... you don't really understand it anyways.So I am going to tell you what I LOVE about this computer and what I use it for. I am a full time college student as well as a single mother who stays busy. I have previously used a HP All In one computer that I bought brand new a year ago and I hate that thing... It is so slow!!! When I first opened this item, I was just hoping that it would be a little faster! What I got instead was an amazing computer that is faster than I could have ever imagined. Now I don't use this thing for much more than amazon reviews, school work, and papers. But this is exactly what I needed.It navigated quickly between web pages, my Microsoft word programs opens instantly and doesn't take forever to load like my HP does. The picture of this monitor is just beautiful. Everything is so clear. I love that the keyboard has a back light so I can see the keys if I need to take a look at them while I am typing, but the back lights go away after a few seconds, so if you are watching a movie, the lit up key board will not bother you.This computer is so light weight and easy to carry. I love the sleek design of it as well. This would be a great computer for anyone who just needs a basic computer for the internet or spreadsheets. I would feel at ease taking this computer with me to college or sending it off to college with my children, and I wouldn't worry if they had the ability to complete their assignments in school. I am so so so happy with this product!\n",

      "  This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.\n",

      "Good choice for basic computing needs\n",
      "  A very reasonably priced laptop for basic computing needs. The specs that stick out to me for describing this as \"basic needs\" is 4GB of RAM, and 128GB M.2 SSD. Both are at the bare minimum in today's needs. Cell phones now come with those specs( high dollar ones though..).Seems like one of the goals of this laptop is to keep an aesthetically pleasing design. Just 1 3.1 USB port and 2 2.0 USB ports are included, one headphone/mic jack, 1 slim RJ45 port, HDMI, and power input plug. No external battery.2 things that stuck out to me when I started using: screen and sound quality. The screen is very sharp and high contrast. Black is actually black. Very impressed. I was also surprised by the audio quality. I don't expect much from laptop speakers, especially low priced ones, but was pleasantly surprised on how clear the audio is.The back panel of the laptop does not have any easy access ports to swap out hard drives or RAM. Instead, you remove 10 or so Philips screws to remove the entire panel. I've already swapped out the 4GB RAM stick for an 8GB. Easy enough.The laptop includes an M.2 SSD. The pro to this is you still have the option of adding a traditional sized disk to expand your storage, without needing to worry about reinstalling an OS or attempting to clone the included drive.Almost puked when I thought I was locked-in to \"S Mode\" When I went to unlock S-mode, Windows kindly directly me to pay >$100 to purchase a license! I was furious thinking this was some new scheme to sell laptops without a full legitimate Windows license and instead lock you into a Microsoft only app store. I forget the exact steps I took, but somewhere I found that there was an error in activating my Windows license, and I had to click a troubleshoot button, then it magically worked and got me out of S mode. Disaster averted.A couple of things that annoy me:-The touchpad feels a little loose to me. Just gently touching it causes it to move and you can hear a plastic on plastic sound, its distracting...-The keyboard backlight turns off after a set amount of time, you must press a key for it to illuminate again. Moving the mouse/touchpad does not cause the keys to light up. You must touch a key. I see the is a BIOS option for disabling the timeout. I've disabled it but it appears to have no effect. It still turns off.-The slim-line RJ45 port seems messed up... I pull the flap down and it does not open far enough to insert a connector. I will probably never use it.. but what gives?\n",

      "  A few months after the purchase....It is still running good and I bought 5 more for my colleagues, so I bought all together 8 machines.  My of my colleagues need more memory while some need less.  So what I do is, for those who need more, I took the 4GB RAM out from their machine and put it in the machine of the colleague who needs less.  So 1 machine got 2x4G running in dual channel with identical RAM and install a new 2x8G for the original machine.  To be honest, difference for 4 to 8 is high, but little difference from 8 to 16.  So those in a tight budget can save your money._____________________This laptop is great.  For this price, there is nothing to complain.I use this for basic computer needs at home.  What I will do with is just Office, surfing, youtube, netflix.  This computer handles it really well, all very smoothly.What I like most is the screen.  It is IPS.  At this price point (310 for me), most laptops are bundled with TN display, which be honestly is a deal breaker.  The screen here is gorgeous.  I do not see much difference to my gaming laptop which cost me thrice.  Sound is good, keyboard design average.  I don't like the small num pad.  Some people complained on the backlight, but I don't need this function.  But the num lock indicator, however, is important but wasn't there.On the spec, there is just 4G of RAM.  You can, however, upgrade it easily.  There are 10 screws at of back.  Open it and you can add another slot of RAM and another HDD.  My recommendation, upgrade to 8 or 16G and add another SDD drive immediately after the setup is done as 128G storage will not be enough.  For gaming, I am yet to test it, but at 310, don't expect anything.Ar..  the Windows S issue, google Windows S Switch and you will know how to change it back to Windows 10 Home.  It is just a few clicks and a few minutes.  Everyone can do it.After all, a great computer.  My family members ordered 2 when they see mine.  Highly recommend.\n",

      "Perfect for kids/teens and seniors\n",
      "  I got this for my ten year old son because it's a great laptop for kids. It has a solid state hard drive which means there's no moving parts and it can take more abuse. In other words I'm not going to worry when my son throws this into his backpack. It's also pretty lightweight and portable.I was, however, a little on the fence about S mode. So what is this? It's a locked down version of Windows 10. It is somewhat limiting in that you can't just run any program you want, it has to be a program solely from the windows store. For example, you have to use Bing as your search engine. You have to use Microsoft Edge as your web browser. For those who are interested in programming, you can't use command-line shells. Pretty limiting right? But the advantage is that the laptop is safer from viruses and malware since there is so much control over what programs can be used. It's very stable and \"safe.\" If it tells you anything, Microsoft markets S-mode laptops to schools because of this safety and stability. Now you can easily scrap the S mode at anytime, but once you leave S mode you can't come back.Other things of note: Upon startup the default settings really lets Microsoft snoop on every little thing you do. I had to disable much of this. If you are handing this over to a kid, I would recommend you do the same. But otherwise, startup was very easy. Cortana talks to you and after you've answered some questions (literally, you can speak the answers) everything is set up.I did notice the speakers are very weak, but honestly I am seldom impressed with laptop speakers. That's when Bluetooth speakers come into play and you can do that easily with this. The screen is not a touch-screen which, I suppose, at this price point you can't really expect.I also saw this laptop has a night setting, which I love. Starting at 8pm, the display minimizes blue light so as not to mess with your body's sleep cycle. That, to me, was a HUGE plus!So would I recommend this? If you are a computer programmer or hope for your kid to be a computer programmer than no, absolutely not. But if you're just wanting to use a computer without necessarily knowing how the parts and software work then YES! This would be a GREAT laptop for you! I can also see this as a great tool for senior citizens as well because if how user-friendly everything is set up to be.\n",

      "  *UPDATE : The labtop completely died near end of warranty, would not charge or power up. Acer replaced motherboard, about 2 weeks turn around time.-The only down side is the 4 gb of ram. 128 nvme is AMAZING at this price, makes the labtop amazingly snappy. Reads are in 1.3-1.4 GB/s range.The display is great for the price, viewing angles are fantastic. Perfect for media consumption. Easily comparable with labtops 2-2.5 times the price. This is bar far my #1 reason for keeping the machine. speakers arent great though, have bluetooth headphones handy.I was able to put POP OS 19 on it without an issue, everything worked perfectly and its very snappy. Due to the nvme you are going to get amazing snappiness.Fully upgradable! There is a included screws to mount 2.5 drive in the box, you can switch wifi card , add another stick  of ram , or swap the M.2.Ram runs at 2400 based on platform, so dont bother with expensive stuff.  The included one is rated at 2666.Stays cool since its a small chip. Fan isnt loud at 100%.Battery life lasts about 3-3.5 hours underload with brightness at 40%.I was able to run dawn of war ii and a few other older games at medium 1080P at half decent frame rates on linux, older games forsure though.Keyboard is good  , much better than idealpad3XX and swift3. I've seen much worst on  much  more expensive devices.I actually really like the aluminium cover, makes the device look premium.This is great machine to consume videos and do light typing without being frustrated by cost or the performance, A+ Acer for putting every dollar where it makes the user experience pleasant .\n",

      "  Got this on sale for $270, which is an absolute steal. Even still, the full price (~$330) is a bargain, too.Despite what the manufacturer has stated in the comments/Q&A, this comes with a vacant bay for a 2.5\" hard drive. It also includes the necessary parts to install the 2.5\" hard drive (mounting bracket, a connection/adapter, and a ribbon to connect it to the mother board).The rear/bottom plastic cover can be removed by unscrewing the 10 screws on the bottom, and GENTLY, with a PLASTIC prying tool, pop the cover off. You have to start at a corner and then slowly/carefully work your way around. Even with great care, I lightly marked the case in a couple of places.UPGRADES:I added a 500 GB HDD (regular, spinning hard drive). Search Amazon for \"2.5\" 500GB\" and take your pick - anywhere from $20-$40 will do the trick. If my instructions above are not enough, Acer's own YouTube channel has a video you can follow.I also added a 4GB stick of RAM to bump the total memory up to 8GB, which is more than enough for this laptop - you're not going to be playing any crazy games or doing any heavy duty stuff like video processing anyways. The specs on the RAM that you should conform to are DDR4 2666 SODIMM 260-Pin (as noted by the manufacturer in the Q&A). Someone mentioned the ram is running at a lower Hz, but best practice would be to buy RAM that matches the stick of RAM the computer comes with.Also, do a search on taking Windows 10 out of \"S\" mode. S mode is a security mode that only allows you to install apps from the Windows Store, which effectively prevents you from inadvertently downloading malware. As long as you use your best judgement when downloading apps (and/or install the antimalware software of your choice), you shouldn't need S-mode.Took all of 10 minutes to uninstall any extra bloatware that came on the computer.Voila, for ~$330 and about 30 minutes of your time, you effectively have a ~$550 laptop.For the price, the processor is very snappy, and the screen is extremely sharp. The keyboard feels very natural & is satisfying to use.\n",

      "  I was very excited by this laptop, as I haven't had one with a bigger screen in quite a while (and have never had one with a backlit keyboard; fancy!). It was pretty easy to set up and I was pretty quickly doing work and playing Fallout New Vegas.HOWEVER, I ended up returning it. The biggest issue for me was that red colors look slightly orange. I compared it to a couple of other screens and it was undeniable (although the Acer tech support people did indeed deny there was anything wrong). For most purposes, this would be fine, but for any kind of graphic design, photo editing, or video work, it is too inaccurate to be useable.Minor complaints with sound: the built-in speakers are so under-powered that I needed headphones for zoom meetings and to watch movies if there was any background noise in the room.  Also, when going back and forth between speakers and the headphone output, it seemed to get confused easily, requiring me to manually change the output settings.In terms of its processing, I had no issues playing Fallout New Vegas, or doing anything else, although Zoom did limit the use of virtual backgrounds due to it being slightly below their required specs.\n",

Needless to say, the problems didn't bode well and I sent this disaster of a machine back.\n",

      "New Computer With 2 Major Problems - Acer Response Awful\n",
      "  It was my first time buying an Acer.  The computer was fine in terms of performance -- except for two problems I had from the start:  1)  The fan kept coming on and the computer's plugged in cord pack (not sure what it's called) would get really hot.  Never had this problem with new laptop before.  2)  I'd be typing with two hands -- and all of a suddenly that little glove pointer hand would appear and move all over the bottom of the screen, and what I was typing would become incorrect.  I called Acer and they had me ship the computer to them for repairs.  It took a week to get to them.  I followed up after they got it to ask how long repairs might take.  Told up to 20 business days. Ok.  Then a little over a week late I get an unexpected UPS delivery -- Acer had returned the computer to me.  I tried it -- same two problems, still there.  I'm imagining they reinstalled the hard drive (and whatever), didn't check it, and put it immediately in the box back to me.  Amazon has accepted the computer back and is issuing a refund.\n",

      "  About 33 days after I received the Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop, I had to use the webcam for work and then I notice it was defective.  It was too late to return to Amazon.  Amazon provided an ACER website for customer service, I tried it  several days because it was down (and is still down as I write this).  I wanted to email ACER customer support, but discover that they do not have any email for customer support (check it yourself).  They do have some support web pages with no human behind.  I was able to enter a chat where I reported that they sold me a defective laptop and wanted it replaced, but they refused (they wanted me to pack it, return it to them, wait for them to get it, wait for them to repair it, and wait to get it back).  I would go through a hassle like that to get it replaced, but not to get it repair (they should not had a sold a defective product).  I wish I had read Acer product reviews before, to see that many people complain that the laptop breaks down after a few weeks of use (I was not so lucky because I did not even had it working a few weeks. Acer just sent me a defective one!).\n",

      "  Six month update: Down grading to two stars: flaky touch pad AND the analog jack for headphone and speakers doesn't work. After checking the Acer community I found out this is a very common issue. I installed new drivers - one worked, one failed to install.With a failed audio jack and a flaky touch pad, I'd look elsewhere for an inexpensive laptop, even though the price is good. The support is just not there - tough to get through - I gave up, suspecting they'd want me to send it back and it's take multiple weeks to return. And might not be fixed.Delivered yesterday: The box comes with a sticker with the URL for instructions on turning off Windows \"S\" mode, and that was no issue. Spent the evening removing junk-ware and adding anti-virus and anti-malware, and shutting off all the \"phone home\" stuff to MS. Network connection was easy, as well. Keyboard is tactile and pleasant, and I'm using the machine as a work processor. Been at it all day, and all is good, EXCEPT! The touch pad is wretched, truly awful. Buy a mouse if you buy this box, else be prepared for phantom left and right mouse clicks that you didn't really do. The cursor also tends to drift even if you aren't moving your finger, and also hesitates and/or ignores other small movements that you did intend to make.\n",

      "This one failed me\n",
      "  I've always liked Acer's laptops. This was my 3rd one. I wanted to like it, but it crapped out on me 14 months later.  I will be disposing of it sometime this week.I purchased Acer's previous ~$350 laptop and added an SSD for the OS and a 1 TB HD for the storage space. That worked well until the laptop hinge broke, forcing me to buy a new laptop. I thought this new version of the ~$350 Acer would work just as well as my previous one, but I was wrong. It was relatively slow from the first use, but acceptable, and further slowed in performance in the following weeks. I occasionally got periods of unresponsive clicks, nonresponsive webpages, blue screens of death, freezes requiring cold boots, and such.I figured I could tolerate all of this since all I needed was a machine to get through my graduate school work: browse the web, open multiple adobe PDF files, work on somewhat large Microsoft Office documents, and sometimes stream HD videos on YouTube/Netflix. However, this machine still struggled to process some of these applications one at a time! I made sure to keep it clean and scanned for malware/viruses regularly to make sure I didn't have bugs slowing it down. Further, it was frequently louder than HP's typical \"airplane mode,\" with the fan blowing hard to cool the laptop down even when it idled with no apps open.I tried multiple times to reinstall a clean version of Windows 10, but came across some error everytime, and Google was minimally helpful. The last time I tried it, my system got erased and I was no longer able to boot the computer.I have decided it belongs in the trash (recycling).Would give it 1 star in general, as I've only listed some of my main complaints, but give it 2 because I did think it looked nice, had a nice surface that was anti-fingerprint marking, and was physically satisfactory. Looked good on the outside, was crap on the inside.\n",

      "  I was happy with the Aspire 5 when I first used it. Then the touch pad stopped working .  The instructions told me to uninstall and reinstall the touch pad. But the touch pad will not show up on the device manager. So I went to Acer's web side for support. I set up an order for repair and was informed that I would receive an e-mail telling me how to ship to the repair center.  I waited a few days, but never received  the e-mail. So I went back to Acer's  web page and entered my case reference number. The astounding response was that my Aspire 5 had been repaired and would be returned by Fedex.  That was amazing since I was typing on the very Aspire 5 that was being shipped back to me. I  So I signed on to chat and tried to explain.  But HAL, the robot decided that I wanted to reinstall Windows 10 and sent me to a page where I could fetch an DVD to reinstall.Needless to say, I was a bit upset by then. But I thought I would give HAL another chance since there seemed to be a problem in communications.  So I asked HAL if I might be able to chat with a real live human being.  The ever helpful decided that I wanted to download drivers for my Aspire 5. Well, I thought I needed to be a bit firmer with HAL and told him that I really, really wanted to chat with a real live human being if such a person even exists at Acer.  But HAL was still convinced that I should install updated drivers, which I had actually done before I ever set up the repair order. So I searched the web site to see if there was anyway to contact a real person..At that point I decided to try Amazon again. Amazon offered me two choices: I could either go back and chat with HAL some more or I could write a review. So my advice to Amazon customers is never, ever order an Acer product from Amazon. In fact I would suggest that you order through WalMart. They still have some real humans working there. But you'd better hurry because HAL is taking over soon.\n",

Once I opened my my new acer laptop and let it complete it's mandatory software update, it left my computer with zero internal memory (116 GB used), this is a major issue and I even uninstalled a large majority of apps not required to run. I have an external 8 TB connected and anything new saving on as well as installed 16 GB of internal RAM which has helped the processing tremendously and is rather fast. My extreme issue is nothing else can be done...no Micrisoft Office, nothing but literally check my email....if I try anything else I get a message there isn't enough internal memory.......Argh......very frustrating. I've purchased an internal 1TB SSD that should arrive soon and I'm hoping this fixes this constant issue I'm experiencing. In addition, I've purchased an external dvd HD drive for watching dvds if possible but currently no internal memory allows nothing but email as of right now.I have mixed feelings on this laptop as it's my first 1 in 21 years and am leaving room for learning but I do know it shouldn't be like this. A rather expensive tasking to make a laptopwork....I will post more once I install the additional memory. Thank goodness this laptop is built with the ability to upgrade and maybe that's the goal of the company...nevertheless less; I supplied 3 stars for screen quality, user friendly set-up, once the RAM upgrade was completed it's very fast and the ability to customize the laptop with tools for reference (you tube videos).\n",

      "  I bought three of these computers and two of them were delivered without an operating system. That is the message you get, there isn't a product key. The little paper you get on the top of the laptop says that if you have issues to contact Acer directly before calling amazon but i wouldn't waste your time. They told me that i could wait a week so they can verify my purchase although i had given them the serial number off of the laptop or i could call amazon and get a replacement. After getting off of the phone with Acer I called amazon, that wasn't that much better. I did get a replacement however I was charged another $377 or something for a new laptop until i returned the other one. the third laptop was purchased on her account, this is where the second laptop without an operating system came from. Before my wife's laptop arrived it wasn't shipped out until about 4 days after purchasing it. she called before they shipped it out and asked why she hadn't gotten an email about it shipping and they said they had a lot of orders which is believable. about a day or two later she got an email stating it shipped but we never received it so about a week went by and she called again. they told her that it had gotten lost in the mail and they were shipping a new one. Five days later a here it is, a laptop without an operating system. So of course the wife calls for the third time and they said that they will arrange that UPS comes out and picks up the package BUT they can not ship her a new one because they are coming from a different vendor now? I'm assuming its because when we purchased them they were $364 and now they are $385 so amazon doesn't want to eat the extra cost. This is the third order amazon has messed up for us in 2 months so we are just going to start paying a little extra at local businesses.As for the laptop, I think it's a good laptop for anyone that needs a better than budget laptop for a budget price. If you leave all the programs on it like microsoft edge instead of google chrome it runs great. it can multi function well. its a little sluggish if you are used to fast computers at work or something then you use this for home browsing, you will definitely notice the difference. I would tell someone that this is a good product if you don't run into the same issues i did. It's just not worth my time to have to call them and ship items back since the 3rd laptop is the second one I am sending back and not even getting a replacement.\n",

      "  I just purchased this new Acer Aspire 5 A515-43-R19L laptop a couple days ago and it has an 'ELAN I2C 'touchpad in it that just doesn't behave like a normal touchpad should behave. The touchpad cursor will suddenly stop moving, and then as long as I'm still rubbing my finger around the cursor will never move again, no matter the pressure applied it remains in one place on the screen. Once I simply lift my finger up and place it back down on the touchpad again, initiating a new cursor session, the cursor will once again start moving.I seem to be able to replicate this touchpad bug more easily by initially applying very light pressure while trying to start to move the cursor, then followed with a little more pressure once it's stuck.In Device Manager the driver is from ELAN , dated 7/12/2019 and the version is 13.6.15.1. The Acer Support technician had me try to uninstall and delete the 'ELAN I2C' driver to simply use the Microsoft standard 'HID-Compliant Mouse' driver, but the touchpad cursor continues to do the same thing even with this standard Windows driver.This erratic behavior with the 'ELAN I2C' touchpad makes an otherwise decent new Acer laptop a serious frustration to try to use. I will likely be returning it, because I don't think there's much else I can do myself to get this buggy touchpad to work correctly.\n",

      "  To summarize, you get what you pay for. I was not expecting to run into so many problems right when I took this out of the box.1. Immediately I heard something loose inside the laptop that was rolling around when I pulled it out of its packaging.2. The sound is so bad it's like buying a pair of earbuds in the the dollar store. The speakers are also under the laptop which makes it worse for the sound quality.3. Loud fan when it gets a little warm when using.4. Scratching sound quality when using multiple tabs. I had about 5 tabs open and while watching youtube videos I noticed the sound would cut out or make scratching noises when it is trying to process all the programs.5. Customer service from both Acer and Amazon makes it difficult to fix your/my issues. I contacted customer service the same day after I received this laptop and also the day after. After telling them all of my issues they suggested to send it to Acer but it will take around 20 business days to have everything fixed.6. Possible restocking fee. Wanting to return this item, even though I barely used it the first 2 days, customer service told me that I cannot send any pictures or videos of the laptop and they would have to inspect it BEFORE they can tell me whether or not I will be charged a restocking fee. If you don't like being surprised by restocking fees, don't buy this laptop so you won't have to return.7, I was recommended to use a separate speaker to fix the audio problem (basically to spend more money just so I can hear sounds without it sounding like a broken audio file.8. Screen quality is definitely not good. I would give it a 6/10. The color difference when using a decent another laptop or monitor, the difference is super noticeable.9. 4gb of ram will not be enough trust me. You would have to buy another ram if you want this to run better and you're basically forking more money just to make this laptop a little bit more usable.I know this has good reviews but don't be fooled by it. I was swayed when I was going through the reviews but after I got my product, I was highly disappointed. I wish I had spent more money to get a more reliable laptop. This one is not worth the regular price. I would say with the issues and quality of this laptop, the price should be around $250.\n",

I can tell you off the bat you're never going to play an AAA title on this... if it even fits on the abysmally small hard drive, that is.Speaking of the hard drive, the hard drive is tiny. It IS an SSD, so it's fast! But it's small. I literally have games that are larger than the drive. But, again, if you're not looking to do much with it, this is overcomeable. I'd recommend increasing it in the future. I will give it a little credit here: there's room for a second hard drive. They obviously saw through this issue from the start.A note: DO NOT SIGN INTO THE OUTLOOK ACCOUNT YOUR OTHER PC USES. I made this mistake and it downloaded nearly 10GB of data the other pc had before I realized what was happening. Disable this option on the laptop before signing into your normal outlook account to do setup. Considering the size of the drive, and my over 400GB of data on my other pc.... it would have crashed the laptop severely.RAM is another issues. 4GB? Please, my kindle has more than this laptop! I bought another 4GB card with the laptop, and by sheer luck they arrived on the same day, from two different companies. But really... when 8GB is the norm... this is unacceptable. My laptop I got five years ago (rest in pieces) was the same brand and had 8GB, and it was the same price.Screen is insanely bright, and the settings go as follows: off, I think that's an icon but can't tell, high noon, staring at the sun. There's no middle ground that's comfortable. It gives me headaches and I can't use it for long periods of time. But, it IS really sharp! The color is excellent! I'll give it a little credit, but like... the lighting levels need some work.Touchpad is lopsided and loose. It actually moves when I use it, and it's LOUD. Thankfully I hate touchpads, and use a mouse instead, because honestly this is the worst touchpad I've ever encountered.While we're on data entry methods, the keyboard backlight shuts off after less than a minute of inactivity. Even if plugged in, which is super annoying.I'm not even going to go into my issues with Windows S-Mode because everyone has already answered that. Took me two hours to find out how to disable that trash without paying.Speakers: Shockingly, this is the best part of this thing. They're clear. They're loud. I keep it at 20% and I'm good. My last Acer could be kept at 100 and people would struggle to hear it from a foot away. But no, I get asked to turn this one down! That's a nice change. I actually love the sound quality and feel it's fantastic. Not \"top of the line\" fantastic but definitely \"this is really nice\" fantastic. I gave it two of the three stars for this alone.Another thing I'll give it serious credit for: my last Acer would turn off randomly in the middle of being used. This one does not. I almost exclusively used the last one plugged in because of that issue and losing work. This one can play simple games without that issue. This is where it got the third star.Considering I bought one of the cheapest laptops just so I could use it to write JavaScript and check Discord when travelling, it's alright. But I'd never use this computer for serious use. I'd never consider it for a child either, as they'd fill up the drive by accident within a week.Seriously, turn around, and shell out the cash for a better laptop. This was the only one within my budget. I literally only got this to travel and it sits unused 90% of the time. I don't want to move my desktop around (and monitors, and all other necessary peripherals...) and this was my fast solution.\n",

      "Well that was a disappointment\n",
      "  This laptop was at the top of my list as far as cost and processing speed, but there seem to be a lot more things to be irritated about than excited about.1. No CD-ROM/DVD-ROM. I have no idea how I missed this. I went to install my printer software and realized there is no drive to do this. I thought it was so common-place that I never even considered a laptop being sold without one. How very bizarre. This means no DVD burning capabilities, no installing a game disc, nothing. Wow. Now maybe I'm old-fashioned since many things are done digitally now, but geez. My bad on not paying attention to the product description. I always back up my photography to disc, ALWAYS. nope, can't with this laptop.2. Why do modern laptops use one single mousepad for right-click, left-click, and moving the cursor? I can't tell you how frustrating that was. I can only use this laptop with an outside USB mouse, otherwise, I would be pulling my hair out every time I touch the thing. I attempted to adjust the sensitivity but with no way of feeling a right or left click, you end up clicking somewhere in the middle half the time.3. The sound on this thing is terrible. I had to buy a USB speaker so I can even hear some stuff. Speakers on the bottom of the laptop, wow. You can cup the sound to try to hear what you are listening to. What a joke.I would rather a laptop be slightly bulkier for better features. I feel that I downgraded from my previous laptop that is at least 5 years old. My last laptop had a larger screen, a mousepad that had separate buttons for right and left click, sound I could hear, AND a DVD-ROM. Wow.Why I gave it two stars? The processing speed is ok. Still, it is no better or worse than any other new computer or laptop I have ever bought, it is just less bogged down with junk when it is new. I almost thought about returning it numerous times, but it sucks to have to delete everything and start fresh again on a new system. I also think there is a restocking fee since it isn't technically broken. Too bad because I would pay more for a system that was more functional. Since I bought the speaker and have the mouse, at least I fixed two of the issues on my own.Hell no to playing video games. I tried playing Cloudpunk on Steam and it lagged so bad I gave up. Sure, you can play games, just not higher quality ones.Lastly because I just can't stop. Why does my backspace key make a weird high-pitched sound? Weird. I do NOT recommend this product and would not buy it again.\n",

      "  So, I got this laptop in August of 2020, it got here in September. Since then I've had two major issues with it. The charger came with stopped working almost right away, but I held off on getting a new one because I didn't want to deal with customer service. When I did and it was finally holding a charge, the keyboard stopped working. Specifically the a, s, z, x, caps, ESC, and 1 key. I have some on and off trouble with the mouse too, it disappears or freezes sometimes. I'm using the on-screen keyboard to type this review right now because I'm fed up with this whole thing. It cost so much money but it couldn't even be functional for a full year when the average laptop lasts 4 to 5. I've bought a laptop through Amazon before, with a different account I think, and it lasted me 7 years. The speakers were much better too. And if you have a problem with this laptop, you'll have to go through the same thing I did. This seller hasn't responded to any emails me or Amazon customer service has sent, and since they're a third-party seller I have to wait to open an Amazon A-to-Z Guarantee Claim. Waiting and waiting. 48 hours for the seller to respond, then another, then waiting a week for the claim to be reviewed, then once more because it wasn't submitted by the first customer service representative. Absolute nightmare. I REALLY wish I'd just gone to the best buy or something when I had the cash in the first place.\n",

      "  I would not recommend buying this.  I purchased in March 2020 to prepare for working remotely.  Everything was fine- it all worked as it should.  Now the built-in camera has stopped functioning properly.  It looks like it is working but there is only a black screen in the image window- for both camera and video.  On zoom calls, it looks like the video is working but there is nothing but a black screen. Open up the camera using the camera app- same thing.  Updating driver shows that the current driver is installed.  Resetting the app does nothing. Resetting privacy settings does nothing. Troubleshooting does nothing- all diagnostics indicate that everything is \"working properly\", no issues. One day it worked fine.  The next day it did not.  Searches on both the Acer community forum on their website and google in general show multiple users all reporting the same exact problem- and following all of the same steps, with absolutely no resolution. Chatting with Acer technical support- the best they can offer is \"try a factory reset\" and if that doesn't work, send it in for repair.  Which of course is impossible because the laptop is now my office for work since my company is still working remotely for the foreseeable future. So in order to send this one in to be repaired, I would need to buy a new one anyway in order to keep my job.  I've had multiple laptops over the years- HP, Asus, samsung-  all worked for years.  This is the first (and hopefully only time) that I've had one stop functioning in less than 4 months after purchase- with no viable resolution offered by the company.**EDIT-  Factory Reset fixed nothing and just made re-setting up everything that was removed a pain in the butt.  Camera is still non-functional.  Acer tech support and customer support useless.  No solution offered other than sending the laptop that I rely on every day in for repair- despite the fact that you can easily google and find the same issue reported by multiple users going back to at least 2018.  Support rep that I spoke to the second time claimed that on their system, they don't show that there are any reported issues with the Aspire 5.  SMH. Worst customer service ever.  And I'll never purchase Acer again.If I could make the rating no stars, I would . Not only did the build-in camera stop working with no apparent solution, a plug & play webcam won't work either.  Uninstall the built-in webcam and it aumotically reinstalls itself.  The P&P webcam works fine on a $200 5 yr old laptop that my 8 yr old has tortured- but won't work on this 9 month old laptop.  Whatever is causing the problem with the built-in camera (that Acer claims isn't a recognized or persistent problem on its machines despite pages of forum posts )  prevents any other camera from working as well.\n",

      "Great computer for the Color Blind.....\n",
      "  I'd like to start off by saying for those that say this device has excellent RGB color output, please and I mean please GET YOUR EYES CHECKED! We as humans can distinguish colors from a pretty young age, so when I saw the orange coloring of everything that was supposed to be red, I figured I might've gotten a dud, a bad apple if you will. Then when I received the replacement, I was shocked to see this brand new \"ISP\" display still had the same color inaccuracy the first one had. Now my previous computer was the Acer Aspire E15, the predecessor to this descendent of the new Aspire series. I compared the two to see If I was really being that picky in terms of color sensitivity, and the results were shocking. Not only does this display have a hard time correctly showing red, but it lacked the ability to show the vibrancy of green, purple, and even pink. Now those are colors that didn't automatically come to my attention, but it was interesting to know the amount of dullness these screens have in comparison to older budget models. Now for those that argue that this is a budget computer, the computer's ability to display color accuracy (Standard colors like BLUE, RED, and GREEN) is something that should at least be set for the general QUALITY of the display. My previous computer, also a budget laptop and an Acer Aspire (see above) had substantial vibrancy in the RGB output. The colors are saturated and the best part is I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. For those that want to test the color accuracy of their screens (correctly) Find a Windows 10 computer or any monitor..pull up \"Choose your accent color\" scroll down and see the color pallet and \"Custom Colors\"...compare those colors to the ones on this laptop, or plug an HDMI cable to another monitor or TV, if the color or the reds are Orange in comparison to what is on your monitor or laptop, you'll know my struggle. Again this is not an issue of colors being a different shade (reds being lighter or darker) this is the inability for the correct color to show up entirely. Now if you're not color sensitive, like I am, and don't expect this \"IPS\" screen to have color accuracy like I did, then this laptop is the perfect machine for you! Functionality wise, I do see the necessary need for the RAM upgrade if needed for anything other than streaming 1080P videos on Youtube. It can be an excellent tool for school, or work (other Photography or media use).  A quick note for Acer: Downgrading elements for functionality and available features are necessary for \"budget\" laptops, but you've taken an \"ISP\" feature and provided an sRGB output and color accuracy that is no better than an Aliexpress laptop! What good is the ISP definition if the colors don't correctly display? ....Also there are no CAP LOCK/NUM LOCK notifications, but turn on the Sticky keys sounds and you'll be fine.\n",

Very tight and needing some force to pull out usb sticks, something I am afraid to eventually break the ports for the long run.

It doesn't fit easily into a standard backpack and when combined with books, notebooks, and a lunchbag, our kid's backpack is REALLY heavy.Save yourself some aggravation and get a Chromebook.

      "  I bought this same laptop last fall and have had no issues with it. I bought another one in late February, and since I have had it, the earphone plug has worked twice. I have troubleshooted this repeatedly, and it always shows that no earphones are plugged in. I have tried two different sets of earbuds, and neither works. Therefore, I have concluded that it is a defect. Also, this laptop has glitched multiple times where the screen just goes black, and I try to hit escape, and it is frozen. The only way I can fix this is to turn it off and then back on. I am certain this isn't supposed to do this. I tried reaching out to the manufacturer but was placed on an indefinite hold. I realize this is most likely attributed to the Coronavirus and the company may be shut down. I need this laptop to work!\n",

      "  UPDATE: After receiving the laptop back from Acer customer service about a month after sending it in, it does turn on HOWEVER it now has the new problem of being unable to see or connect to any wireless networks. A call to customer support and they tell me I need to factory reset. I told them I didn't want to lose all my information from the computer and that this is a problem it never had before being sent in. They told me to use an external drive and back it up. What a headache, I will not buy Acer products again.I bought this laptop new in March and as of today it is completely dead. No charging light, no turning on, no nothing. I used it two days ago and it was fine. I tried all the troubleshooting for the battery including the manual battery button, power cycling, static draining, and checking the power cord. Acer is going to take it in to fix it but I have to pay shipping and they will take approximately 20 business days to fix it. I appreciate the effort but a laptop dying after 8 months seems inexcusable. If I could go back, I would purchase something else.\n",

      "  So I bought this machine because my previous laptop died after several years of service. I needed something \"cheap and quick\", but I saw all the great reviews on this.  I was expecting to be pleasantly surprised with a value packed computer - but no, I got what I paid for.The display is good, the battery life is decent, and I appreciate the backlit keyboard.  HOWEVER, there's four major problems I cannot overlook:Wifi speed - I can usually get 250-300 Mbps easily.  This barely gets 80.  I have tested this repeatedly vs. cell phone speeds, and other laptops in my house - and something is limiting the wifi in this machine to go full speed.  This is unacceptable.  (And I know 80 is in the zone of \"decent speed\" - but it's a downgrade from what I was getting on an 8 year old laptop)Audio - The sound is terrible and there's a lot of crackling/popping.  For someone who loves music and watches a lot of youtube, this is also unacceptable.Trackpad - not very responsive and consistently sees a \"right click\" near the mid-line of the trackpad as a \"left click\".  This is more than likely me getting use to the trackpad, but it still doesn't work as well as it should.RAM use: I installed another 4 MB of ram as suggested - and even then programs like Firefox, etc.  still run a bit sluggish.I will continue to troubleshoot to see if there's something wrong.  But I am not a fan of this computer in it's current state.  Next time, I will not be buying an Acer computer.\n",

      "OK..terrible keyboard, low RAM\n",
      "  I bought this as it was mentioned #1 on a site listing best Under $500 gaming laptops. I was given pause that it had such low RAM (4g) but it looked easy enough to upgrade so dropped another $50 on a 16G ram set.The laptop itself seems OK...everything worked. I didn't have super high expectations at the 350 or so price point.The ram upgrade was not too bad. It could have been easier. An access panel for such an obvious upgrade would have been preferred to having to take the whole back panel off. But all in all, acceptable.The screen seems not terribly crisp to me. It is OK but..meh. I haven't tried too many games to really put it thought its paces yet but what I have tried ran well.My biggest complaint is the keyboard. If I would have looked at this closer I probably would have passed on the purchase. The keys are tiny and flat. The number pad is all jacked up with keys that are traditionally on the far right placed up above the num pad. Anyone that uses a num pad will quickly be annoyed as your traditional typing is not possible. Also in order to use the F1-F12 keys you have to hold down a FN key..otherwise those keys default to multimedia functions like volume up and down. I read this may be able to be adjusted in the bios but i have yet to check.  For me...the keyboard is just to small and awkward. If you are wanting to use this for gaming or work that is keyboard or typing intensive you may want to look elsewhere.My gut feeling is this was made to be bare bones no frills laptop with above average CPU and graphics power for the price point knowing it was ripe for upgrading (take out of Win S mode and RAM). As it is, pretty week, but if you are willing to upgrade the ram the guts become pretty solid. Everything else about it is kind bleh.\n",

From time to time it will heat up, and I did figure it out that the Laptop was not able to handle this amount of extensions, but the Laptop was only for writing, and minor programs uses, and web browsing.It was never used outside of the house, never dropped, clean daily (due to my OCD), and obviously, it was like my baby.A week ago, died, out-of-the blue, no warning... the screen went black while watching a series. Now reading through Amazon reviews, I see that it is a regular and common problem. Of course, Acer didn't do s*** due to being out-of-warranty, exactly a month after.Never buy Acer. I got a Deskstop Acer that my parents gave me on 2007, and it died within a year. So, I thought they changed... wrong. This company creates cheap stuff and they know it.My HP Laptop from 2011 is still working like charm. Hopefully, with the ASUS that I got, I can last another 8 years.Do yourself some favor... save money and buy a good Laptop. Also, the hard drive from Samsung that I got is working, the rams, the HDD... it was the main-board that and the cheap fan that cannot handle the heat of good performance extension.

And the agent also said you cannot add 500GB SSD which is NOT true!!!!! I ended up bringing it to Best Buy for a quick consultation. They took a look and found that ram is working in one of RAM slots (it has 2 slots) and the other one is defective by some sort of dirts or something. I'm so dissapointed cuz I was quite excited and always thought Acer laptops are quite nice. The laptop itself is very nice I cannot deny.

      "  I bought this entry level Acer as an extra to have around and wasn't expecting much for the price.  Everything about this computer is very good EXCEPT for the low volume of the sound.  I'm not talking about quality of sound but the actual volume. I wasn't expecting BOSE quality, but I was expecting the volume to be loud when on 100%; it isn't.  Here's what I did, checked drivers, opened the Realtek to confirm all were set at 100%.  Upon researching other reviews, I noticed similar low volume issues; it appears that this is where Acer skimped. (I have an entry level Toshiba that has horrible quality sound, but it is loud.) I need to Blu-tooth an external speaker just so I don't have to bring my ears to w/in 8\" just to hear.  Of course, it doesn't help that Acer put the speakers on the bottom, yes, the bottom of the unit. It's a shame that Acer did so much right for the price, only to mess up on a incredibly low volume!  Would it have really been that more expensive for them to make the sound louder at 100%?  The answer to my rhetorical question is no, but they did anyway.Overall, I would have given the unit 4 stars, maybe even 5, but the horrible max volume of the speakers rates this unit a 3, at best, unfortunately.My take-away is that I won't buy another Acer without hearing the sound first.\n",

      "  The initial setup was easy, so that’s one of the few pluses. The screen, while big, has a resolution that makes the words blurry. I bought this to make a computer based college class easier. While functions in Microsoft Access may be more developed on this operating system than Macs, it is legitimately frustrating using the touchpad on this thing. Maybe I have to dial in the touchpad’s functions more, but MacBooks are so much simpler in this aspect. It automatically highlights things when I just want to scroll, clicks when I’m just scrolling, picks and chooses when it pauses when I use the space button, and enters full screen when I’m just trying to drag a pane to the side. I waste more time dealing with this than I do working on the classwork.\n",

      "  This computer has me at the end of my rope. I had so much hope for it . I wanted to love it. I called the Help line for help and they wanted my my credit card number. They charged me on their help line! Don't buy it! The touch pad has one tiny spot that works. If you miss it very strange things happen. Don't buy it!  It jumps all over the place, from site to site for no apparent reason. I wanted an easy to operate computer. This is not it!  Many of the function are so poorly set up I can't  figure what they are talking about. I'm not an unintelligent, I hold an under graduate degree and 2 Masters. I am an artist, writer and illustrator. I believe its going back on Monday.\n",

Works fine when plugged in to power but after owning it a while I've noticed a steady decline in the battery life... faster than any laptop I've ever owned.  In the beginning it would stay on for 6-7 hours but after a few months passed and it was down to 3-4 and now after less than18 months I barely get 1 hour.\n",

      "  The hardware is nice. I bought this for my son to complete schoolwork remotely during the worldwide COVID-19 quarantine. Unfortunately, I was met with 2 problems. 1) It comes with Windows10 S, which is some kind of garbage filled with limitations such as not even being allowed to install the Chrome browser. 2) I was not able to get Windows to activate. Spoke with Microsoft tech support, who initiated a remote session and informed me that I did not have a genuine copy of windows installed. So, I had to spend another $150 to purchase a legit Windows 10 Home key to activate my new laptop to switch out of the 'S Mode' garbage.I didn't even know shipping illegitimate copies of Windows was legal! Perhaps there's some caveat for the S mode that allows vendors to sell laptops cheaper?$150 later though, I have been pleased with my purchase. So, just a heads up to buyers for what to expect.\n",

      "  Within 1 day of receiving this computer, I encountered a problem where when I would try to watch a video, I would get a black screen for a few seconds. I contacted customer service and attempted to fix it twice, but the glitching black screen continued to occur. I need this computer for school so sending it for repair which will take 10 days is too long. Another issue I dealt with is that the laptop gets really hot and the fan whirs very loudly. I've never had issues like these with any of my previous laptops especially within 1 week of purchasing! I think I got a defective laptop. This laptop has given me a headache.\n",

      "  When it arrived, I spent a couple of hours setting it up. The next morning, it was dead. It wasn’t receiving a charge. I decided to be patient and wait for acer to send a replacement AC cable, which solved that problem. However, 2 weeks later, the sound card (which was terrible in the first place) gave out. I tried to reboot to see if that would fix the problem, and although the machine powered up, windows never came back. Returned it today, so now more delays in getting a new laptop up & running.\n",
